# if-else statement
# if-else statement is used when a different sequence of instructions are to be executed depending on the logical value(True/False) og the condition evaluated

# if the condition is True then if block statement will executed and if condition is False then else block of statement will run

# a = int(input("enter first number: "))
# b = int(input("enter second number: "))

# if a > b:
# print("first number was greater")
# else:
# print("second number was greater")

# print("first number was greater") if a > b else print("second number was greater")
# if we have single statement then we can write it in single line

# a = int(input("enter number greater than 5: "))
# if a > 5:
    # print("You have entered ", a, "which is greater than 5")
# elif a == 5:
    # print("you have entered", 5, "which equal")
# else:
    # print("you have entered", a, "which is less than 5")
