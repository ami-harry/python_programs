# list
# list are like array where we can store data of any type and can be modified and accessed through their +ve/-ve index nos.. it is denoted  by []

# tuple
# tuples are like list but these are only like read only. meanwhile theirs values cannot be modified. it is represented by ()

# print(aa)
# print(aa[3])

# it represents a sequenced of numbers. values cann't be modified

# set {}
# sets is an unordered collection of elements
# order of elements are not maintained so it cann't be access through index no
# it does not accept duplicate values
# it is represented by {}
# it will give output in unordered format
# values cannt be modified  

# hk={10,20,49,"hk", "harry"}

# a dict represents a group of elements in the form of [key:value] pair.
# elements can be accesed through key
