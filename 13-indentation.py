# indentaition
# indentation refers to the spaces that are used in the begginning of  a statment. bydefault python puts 4 spaces but it can be changed manually by the programmer.

# if 4 > 2:
    # # print("4 is greater than true") #here 4 spaces are before print statment this is called indentation 
    # print("this is 2nd statement of if condition")
    # if 2==2:
        # # print("this is first statment of 2nd if condition") # here 8 spaces are before statement this is nested if ..first 4 spaces is for father and 2nd 4 spaces is for child
# if 5<6:
    # print("this is first statement of anoter if condition")
# print("here are the rest of the codes")
