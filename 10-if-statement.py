# if statement
# it is used to execute an instruction or block of instruction only if a condition is fulfillec

# if(condition): --> first the condition is tested, if the condition is true
    # statement -->then the given statements after condition are executed.
# .... after condition in the next line .. meanwhile before the statement of if condition we must give 4 spaces or nident . this shows that that statement is of if condition and will execute as per if condition. if we dint maintain indent then the statement will be considered as outside from if area. and will not follow if conditions.
