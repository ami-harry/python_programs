# an abstract class can have abstract methods as well as concrete method but all methods of an interface are abstract
# we use abstract class when there are some common features shared by all the objects as they are while use interface if all the features used to be implemented differently for different objects
# is programmer job ti write child class fro abstract class while in interface, any third party vender will take responsiblity to write child class
# interface are slow when compared to abstract class
