# close()
#
# # # Python file method close() closes the opened file. A closed file cannot be read or written any more. Any operation, which requires that the file be opened will raise a ValueError after the file has been closed. Calling close() more than once is allowed.
#
# # Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is reassigned to another file. It is a good practice to use the close() method to close a file.
#
