# input()
# this function is used to accept the input from keyboard
# this function will stop the program flow untill the user gives an input and end the input with the return
# whatever used gives input bydefault input accept it as a string. so we have to use the typecast to take input as per our choice.
# syntax--> input("prompt")
# prompt is a string or message for the user that what he have to give input

# value=input()
# print("you have entered ",value,sep="\n",)
# here input promt is empty so the user dont know that what he has to enter. so we must take care of that to give a message to user that what he has to do
# 
# h=input("enter your name: ")
# here a message will be displayed that enter your name so the user will enter his name
# print("your name is",h)
# print(type(h))

# 
# h1=input("enter your phone no:")
# print("your phone no is",h1)
# print(type(h1))
# here we have entered digit but it is as string so we have to used typecast as int
# h2=int(input("enter your phone no:"))
# print("your phone no is",h2)
# print(type(h2))
# now the output is same but the type has changed as int
