# list[]
# a list represents a group of elements
# list are very similar to array but there is major difference, an array can store only one type of element whereas a list can store different type of elements.
# list are mutable so we can modify its element
# a list can store different types of element which can be modified
# list are dynamic which means size is not fixed
# lists are represented using square bracket []

'''

# creating a list
# a list is similar to array that consist a group of element of item

a = [10, 20, 45.54, 'harry', 'ishrat']
print("at a[3]  is ", a[3])
print(" at a[4] is ", a[4])
print()
print(type(a))
# modifying list
print("The original list before modification ")
print(a)
print("The address of list before modification is ", id(a))
print()
# updating the list
a[4] = 'Manisha'
print("The updated list is ")
print(a)
print("The address of list after modification is ", id(a))
print("\nbefore and after modification the memory address is same, no new object is crerate after modification so list are mutable, if a new memory address is generated after modification the that object is not mutable it is imutable")
'''

# empty list
# a=[] #this is empty list
# index
# an index represents the position of an list element. index starts from 0 onwards and written inside square bracket

# a = [12, 34, 34.35, "Harry"]
# we can acces it from index 0 to n or -1 to -n
