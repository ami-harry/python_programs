# the computer scans an expression which contains the operators form left to tifhr and perform only one operation at a time. the expression will be scanned many times to produce the output. the order in various operations are performed is known as hierarchy of operations oor operator precedence. some of the operators of the same level of precedence are evaluated from left to right or right to left . this is refrerred associtivity.
# 1.    ()              --> paranthese
# 2.    **              --> exponential
# 3.    +, -, ~         --> unary plus, unary minus,bitwise Not
# 4.    *, /, //, %     --> multiplication, division, floor division, modulus
# 5.    +,-             --> addition , substraction
# 6.    << , >>         --> Bitwise left shift, Bitwise right shift
# 7.    &               --> Bitwise AND
# 8.    ^               --> Bitwise XOR
# 9.    >,>==,<,<==,==,!=   --> Relational operator
# 10.   =, %=, /=, //=, +=, -=, **=, *= --> assignment operator
# 11.   is, is not      -->identiry operator
# 12.   in , not in     --> membership operator
