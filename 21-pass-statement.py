# pass statement
# pass statement is used to do nothing. it can be used inside a loop or if statement to represent no operation. pass us useful when we need statement syntatically correct but we do not want to do any operation.


# if(condition):
    # pass -->here if condition is true then it will do nothing just will jump out of loop
# else:
    # statement -->if condition is false then else block will execute


# if 5>2: --here the condition is true then nothing will happen
    # pass
# else:
    # print('hey i am else blcok')
# print(' i m out of loop')

# if 2>4: -->here the condition is false so else block will execute
    # pass
# else:
    # print('im else block')
# print(' i m out of loop')
